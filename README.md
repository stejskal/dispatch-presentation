dispatch-presentation
=====================

This is the demo code used in a Dispatch presentation given at the [USE Scala group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/usescala) meeting on 6/5/13.  The code consists of a server which uses Play 2.1.1 and a series of example code files build with sbt.  The sbt config contains
the sbt-idea plugin so if you want to use the demo source code in intellij you can run gen-idea from within sbt and it will create an intellij project for you to use.

There is also a Prezi that was used in the presentation that can be found here: http://prezi.com/jb9m8e0tpkm_/?utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=copy
